# ChatGPT Split Assistant Chrome Extension ðŸ§ ðŸ’¬

## ðŸ§  What is it?

The **ChatGPT Split Assistant** is a Chrome extension that enhances your experience on the ChatGPT website by splitting the screen into two sections:

- The **main window (75%)** is used for your primary ChatGPT conversation.
- The **assistant window (25%)** opens a second ChatGPT chat where you can ask follow-up questions or request clarification on any step â€” like a personal tutor.
